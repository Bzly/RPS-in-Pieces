# RPS in Pieces v2
An alternative stylesheet for Rock Paper Shotgun. 

[![Install directly with Stylus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Install%20directly%20with-Stylus-00adad.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bzly/RPS-in-Pieces/main/rps.user.css)

## What does it do?
Tidies up the site design: removes strange blank panels, centres bits, removes excess padding, shrinks the site header and footer, removes the post-page 'shelves', etc.

Additionally, it allows for you to turn the site into 'dark mode' and hide the 'deals' articles (both are enabled by default, configurable in options).

## Installation
1. Install a browser extension such as Stylus \[[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/styl-us/)\]

## To-do
* Check mobile view (it's probably terrible) and add @media stylings as necessary
	* Stylus for Firefox Android doesn't work any more â€” are there actually any addons that do?
* Work on the homepage
* Add comment backgrounds to staff?
